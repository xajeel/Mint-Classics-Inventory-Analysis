# Mint-Classics-Inventory-Analysis
## **SUMMARY**

Mint Classics Company, a retailer of classic model cars and other vehicles, is looking at closing one of its storage facilities.

To support a data-based business decision, they are looking for suggestions and recommendations for reorganizing or reducing inventory, while still maintaining timely service to their customers.

## **TASK / OBJECTIVE**

Conduct an exploratory data analysis to investigate if there are any patterns or themes that may influence the reduction or reorganization of inventory in the Mint Classics storage facilities.

1. Explore products currently in inventory.
2. Determine important factors that may influence inventory reorganization/reduction.
3. Provide analytic insights and data-driven recommendations.

## **RESULTS / INSIGHTS**

1. **Trains:** Trains exhibit the lowest sales velocity, inventory turnover, and high inventory-to-order ratio, indicating potential overstocking. Consider reducing or removing train inventory.
2. **Ships, Planes, Trucks, and Buses:** These categories have relatively low sales velocity, suggesting slower demand. While ships, trucks, and buses show a low inventory-to-order ratio, planes have a higher ratio, warranting attention. Their average order time is also relatively high, indicating potential inefficiencies in stock management.

In summary, optimizing train inventory is a priority, and ships, planes, trucks, and buses require closer evaluation for potential inventory adjustment and improved supply chain efficiency.

## **RECOMMENDATIONS**

1. Consolidating the low-performing product categories into one warehouse. This could potentially free up space in other warehouses and lead to more efficient storage.
2. Alternatively, consider discontinuing some or all of the low-performing product categories. This would involve phasing out these products from the product line and reallocating resources to more successful categories.
